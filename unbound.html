				<h3>Medline</h3>
				<p><a href="https://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline" target="blank">Unbound Medline</a> (now called Prime) is a mobile and web application that helps medical librarians and researchers find medical literature. It provides a simple interface to query the PubMed database, save searches, and discover new content.</p>
				<p>My favorite part of the app was our ability to represent articles and their connections to one and other graphically. We would give researchers information about an article’s relative importance by using a system of colors and shapes to map out all of it's references and citations.

				<h3>Windows Phone Design</h3>
				<p>In addition to adding some minor features and polishing the visual design of the existing iOS and Android applications, I was responsible for porting the design over to Windows Phone 7 when Microsoft introduced it.</p>
				<p>It was an interesting challenge because the interaction patterns and aesthetics were very different from what iOS and Android were doing at the time. We worked hard to maintain some cross-platform consistency while still adhering to Microsoft’s new design guidelines. One of the apps built on our platform, Relief Central, was selected by Microsoft as a winner of their Federal Apps Contest. The CTO, lead developer, and myself were interviewed by Microsoft for a segment on their developer blog.

				<h3>Tablet Redesign</h3>
				<p>For a few months I worked on a project to increase conversions from free to paid plans. The team that I was working with learned that the users were dropping out of our conversion funnel at a higher rate than other comparable products. Only about .5% of users who clicked on the “Upgrade” button in our app converted to a paid plan. Our goal was to increase that to 2%.
				<p>This project was especially fun for me because our goals were directly measurable and the team could really rally behind them. We did multiple rounds of AB tests and refined the designs based on our learnings. In the end we were able to greatly surpass our 	original goal and increased the conversion percentage to about 8%.
