				<p class="description">In 2012 I moved to the West Coast to work for Box, a rapidly-growing enterprise content management platform with over 25 million active users. I leared a great deal about product development processes and had the opportunity to work with some very talented Desginers and Engineers.

				<h3>Box Sync</h3>
				<p><a href="https://sites.box.com/sync4/" target="blank">Box Sync</a> was an application for  Mac and Windows that enabled users to sync files and folders between their computer and Box’s cloud platform. It was an interesting challenge and it it taught me how much work is required to ship a product that feels seamless and invisible.</p>
				<p>Although there was a minimal UI, most of the design work here was in making sure that these applications could “play nice” with all of the collaboration and customization features in the web application. We also took a great deal of care to either avoid edge cases or handle the ones we had gracefully.

				<h3>Web Application</h3>
				<p>I worked on a variety of small features across Box’s <a href="https://www.box.com/file-sharing" target="blank">web application</a> including security settings in the admin console, updates to the in-app notification experience, and a redesign of the header. My favorite project, however, was designing collaboration features for their file preview interface.</p>
				<p>One of the more unique things about Box’s platform was it’s ability to render in-browser previews for over 100 file types including videos, 3D models, and Adobe CS files. In this view users could interact with their content by sharing it, commenting on it, tracking version history, or performing any of the file management tasks that you would expect a desktop file system to do.

				<h3>Freemium Upgrades</h3>
				<p>For a few months I worked on a project to increase conversions from free to paid plans. The team that I was working with learned that the users were dropping out of our conversion funnel at a higher rate than other comparable products. Only about .5% of users who clicked on the “Upgrade” button in our app converted to a paid plan. Our goal was to increase that to 2%.
				<p>This project was especially fun for me because our goals were directly measurable and the team could really rally behind them. We did multiple rounds of AB tests and refined the designs based on our learnings. In the end we were able to greatly surpass our 	original goal and increased the conversion percentage to about 8%.
